# Typescript

## Tech with Tim
- Enhanced version of JS. Strict Superset of JS. It behaves like a compiled language so you catch errors at compilation instead of at runtime.
- Interchangeable with JS. TS can be transpiled into native JS.
- TS builds on top of JS by adding INTERFACES, STATIC TYPES, and GENERICS and at runtime, compiles to JS because the browser can't run TS.

- Scales better.
- in TS, you have TYPE ENFORCEMENT
- STATIC TYPING and ENFORCEMENT is important because it makes catching errors easier at compile time instead of runtime as is the case with JS.

## Typescript in 100 Seconds
- Strict, typed superset of JS that has error handling at compile time as opposed to runtime as JS does.
- TS can also infer types like JS does (JS is a dynamically typed language) or you can explicitly declare types of variables or opt out of it and have default JS behavior.
- You can define your own custom types or Interfaces (look like classes)

## Typescript vs JavaScript by Ben Awad
Pros: 
- Compiler catches error
    Smaller feedback loop
    Makes refactoring easier
- autocompletion/autoimports
- you can gradually adopt it
- more companies are adopting it

*Typing avoids type coercion of JS.
*It shows error at compile (as you code in the file)
*TS works with VS Code very well. (You can add all missing imports)
*calling functions from imports, VS CODE will tell you the types of the arguments it expects
*ctrl + space will bring up the autocomplete menu which can save you time.
*It can require less time in referencing documentation.

Cons: 
- It takes time

## What is TypeScript with Harry Wolff
- Optional Static Typing superset of JS
- Great integration with VS Code

## Learn TypeScript - Full Course for Beginners from freeCodeCamp.org
- TS is the most popular static typing extension for JS.
- Two main reasons why TS is better than JS.
    Erros can be catched earlier than with JS. at Compile time (in the editor or console) as oppposed to at runtime
